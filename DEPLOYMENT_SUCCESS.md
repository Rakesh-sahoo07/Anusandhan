## 🔍 Verify Contracts (Optional but Recommended)

Wait 2-3 minutes for Etherscan to index your contracts, then verify them:

```bash
cd contracts

# Verify ResearchNFT
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xb257683a2Ca62C13A27aBD8566BB747b00F09d56

# Verify ResearchMarketplace
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xEAA5Acc922704DDb42Bc1Fa72c97842df0B77903 "0xCaC524BcA292aaade2DF8A05cC58F0a65B1B3bB9" "0xb257683a2Ca62C13A27aBD8566BB747b00F09d56" "0xc02165A362fae2A55d4341e71e262D6Ad1c8F301"
```

**Benefits of verification:**
- ✅ Users can read your contract code on Etherscan
- ✅ Increased transparency and trust
- ✅ Ability to interact directly on Etherscan UI

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Transaction failed"
- Check you have enough Sepolia ETH for gas
- Verify you're on Sepolia network
- Check contract addresses are correct

### "NFT minting failed"
- Ensure you've approved the transaction
- Check you have enough gas
- Verify the project CID hasn't been minted before

### "Marketplace listing failed"
- You must approve the marketplace to manage your NFT first
- Check the NFT is actually minted
- Verify you own the NFT

### "Purchase failed"
- Ensure you have enough PYUSD
- Approve PYUSD spending first
- Check you're not trying to buy your own NFT
- Verify the listing is still active

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Use Multiple Wallets**
   - One for creating/selling
   - One for buying
   - Test the full marketplace flow

2. **Start Small**
   - List NFTs for small amounts (1-10 PYUSD)
   - Test with minimal gas costs

3. **Monitor on Etherscan**
   - Watch transactions in real-time
   - Debug any issues using transaction logs

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try minting the same project twice (should fail)
   - Try buying your own NFT (should fail)
   - Try listing without approval (should fail)
